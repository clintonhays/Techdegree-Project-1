          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>For the past 5 years I have lived and worked in South Korea as an ESL teacher. It has been a rewarding experience, if not always fulfilling. I've learned a lot as an educator. The most important thing to remember is that not all students are the same. They do not learn the same way, they do not grow the same way, and they do not engage the same way. I believe that this principle can be applied to my web designs. Making sure that the websites I design are accessible and enjoyable to the broadest contingent of people is one of my main goals.</p>

          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>In 2009, I recieved a BA in Creative Studies from the University of Central Oklahoma. My course of study taught me many valuable lessons. The first of which is how to think creatively. Since I am usually more of a logical thinker, it was very important for me to develop techniques to break out of my, sometimes, rigid mindset. Second, I learned that there is no better friend to the professional creative than organization. Staying on task and having a well-formulated plan helps me to combine the logical and creative to deliver the solutions needed for any task I'm facing.</p>
